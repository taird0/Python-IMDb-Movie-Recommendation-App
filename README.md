This project was made for my CodeCademy "Recommendation Software Project".

The app asks the user for a genre of movie - 
Scrapes the IMdB website for most popular movies in that genre - 
Sorts the Movies by rating ascending - 
offers the user the highest rated - most popular movies until user has found a movie to watch
